## DataSet
- [Motor Vehicle Collisions Involving Killed or Seriously Injured Persons](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/motor-vehicle-collisions-involving-killed-or-seriously-injured-persons/)
  

## Description
We intend to utilize Motor Vehicle Collisions KSI (Killed or Seriously Injured) data from https://www.toronto.ca/ to forecast the likelihood of a fatal outcome in an accident based on specific input variables, including visibility, road condition, impact type, speeding (yes/no), aggressive driving (yes/no), alcohol involvement (yes/no), running a red light (yes/no), being over the age of 70 (yes/no), and being a new driver (age 15 to 19).

This data analysis has the potential to contribute to accident prevention efforts by promoting safer driving behaviors in specific areas.
